// v4.54: (1) coverless-enforcement regex tightened — "no back cover damage/wear"
// no longer zeroes a clean cover's sub-score (ASM 55 back=0 bug). (2) Deep
// assessment: disproven/negligible initial defects are DELETED not kept at LOW,
// confirmations are never logged as defects, and a book with zero confirmed
// defects is graded on merit up to 9.8 instead of defaulting to 9.4.
// v4.53 (bundled prompt fixes over Opus-5 v4.51):
//  1. EVIDENCE STANDARD in Phase 1 — defects must be visibly present and
//     localizable; curbs Opus 5's fabrication of phantom edge/corner/spine wear
//     on clean high-grade books (v4.51 under-graded 9.0+ books ~1.8 grades).
//     Banded-wear summaries gated on visible wear; blackjack "count when unsure"
//     clarified to severity-uncertainty only, not presence-uncertainty.
//  2. Defect fields are descriptive only — no "pressing/cleaning candidate" or
//     any remediation advice in the defects array.
//  3. Page quality listed as a defect ONLY when below White, or tanning/foxing
//     or interior damage present; White+clean interiors emit no PQ entry.
